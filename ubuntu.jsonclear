In version 3.0.5 and earlier, the `forgot-password` endpoint in Flowise returns sensitive information including a valid password reset `tempToken` without authentication or verification. This enables any attacker to generate a reset token for arbitrary users and directly reset their password, leading to a complete account takeover (ATO). This vulnerability applies to both the cloud service (`cloud.flowiseai.com`) and self-hosted/local Flowise deployments that expose the same API. Commit 9e178d68873eb876073846433a596590d3d9c863 secures password reset endpoints. Several recommended remediation steps are available. Do not return reset tokens or sensitive account details in API responses. Tokens must only be delivered securely via the registered email channel. Ensure `forgot-password` responds with a generic success message regardless of input, to avoid user enumeration. Require strong validation of the `tempToken` (e.g., single-use, short expiry, tied to request origin, validated against email delivery). Apply the same fixes to both cloud and self-hosted/local deployments. Log and monitor password reset requests for suspicious activity. Consider multi-factor verification for sensitive accounts."

         "summary" : "Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. In versions prior to 4.9.7, a flaw in the `bodyLimit` middleware could allow bypassing the configured request body size limit when conflicting HTTP headers were present. The middleware previously prioritized the `Content-Length` header even when a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header was also included. According to the HTTP specification, `Content-Length` must be ignored in such cases. This discrepancy could allow oversized request bodies to bypass the configured limit. Most standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies may reject such malformed requests with `400 Bad Request`, so the practical impact depends on the runtime and deployment environment. If body size limits are used as a safeguard against large or malicious requests, this flaw could allow attackers to send oversized request bodies. The primary risk is denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory or CPU consumption when handling very large requests. The implementation has been updated to align with the HTTP specification, ensuring that `Transfer-Encoding` takes precedence over `Content-Length`. The issue is fixed in Hono v4.9.7, and all users should upgrade immediately."

Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`.

In v0.7.2-beta.2 in the `packages/stage-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.vue` path, the Markdown content is processed using the useMarkdown composable, and the processed HTML is rendered directly into the DOM using v-html. An attacker creates a card file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, then simply processes it using the highlightTagToHtml function (which simply replaces template tags without HTML escaping), and then directly renders it using v-html, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The project also exposes the Tauri API, which can be called from the frontend. The MCP plugin exposes a command execution interface function in `crates/tauri-plugin-mcp/src/lib.rs`. This allows arbitrary command execution. `connect_server` directly passes the user-supplied `command` and `args` parameters to `Command::new(command).args(args)` without any input validation or whitelisting. Thus, the previous XSS exploit could achieve command execution through this interface. v0.7.2-beta.3 fixes the issue."

If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer\npointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed.\n\nThis behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without\n'commit 6f18d174b73d (\"bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer\nis written\")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before\nupdating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to\naccess the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the\nchance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an\nevent pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed\none, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all\nof the TREs in between the two read pointers.\n\nThis commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the\nevent points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.\n\n[mani: added stable tag and reworded commit message]"

The intent is\nto improve processing time of large BIOs by splitting them into smaller\noperations that can be parallelized on different CPUs.\n\nFor zoned dm-crypt targets, this BIO splitting is still done but without\nthe parallel execution to ensure that the issuing order of write\noperations to the underlying devices remains sequential. However, the\nsplitting itself causes other problems:\n\n1) Since dm-crypt relies on the block layer zone write plugging to\n   handle zone append emulation using regular write operations, the\n   reminder of a split write BIO will always be plugged into the target\n   zone write plugged. Once the on-going write BIO finishes, this\n   reminder BIO is unplugged and issued from the zone write plug work.\n   If this reminder BIO itself needs to be split, the reminder will be\n   re-issued and plugged again, but that causes a call to a\n   blk_queue_enter(), which may block if a queue freeze operation was\n   initiated. This results in a deadlock as DM submission still holds\n   BIOs that the queue freeze side is waiting for.\n\n2) dm-crypt relies on the emulation done by the block layer using\n   regular write operations for processing zone append operations. This\n   still requires to properly return the written sector as the BIO\n   sector of the original BIO. However, this can be done correctly only\n   and only if there is a single clone BIO used for processing the\n   original zone append operation issued by the user. If the size of a\n   zone append operation is larger than dm-crypt max_write_size, then\n   the orginal BIO will be split and processed as a chain of regular\n   write operations. Such chaining result in an incorrect written sector\n   being returned to the zone append issuer using the original BIO\n   sector.  This in turn results in file system data corruptions using\n   xfs or btrfs.\n\nFix this by modifying get_max_request_size() to always return the size\nof the BIO to avoid it being split with dm_accpet_partial_bio() in\ncrypt_map(). get_max_request_size() is renamed to\nget_max_request_sectors() to clarify the unit of the value returned\nand its interface is changed to take a struct dm_target pointer and a\npointer to the struct bio being processed. In addition to this change,\nto ensure that crypt_alloc_buffer() works correctly, set the dm-crypt\ndevice max_hw_sectors limit to be at most\nBIO_MAX_VECS << PAGE_SECTORS_SHIFT (1 MB with a 4KB page architecture).\nThis forces DM core to split write BIOs before passing them to\ncrypt_map(), and thus guaranteeing that dm-crypt can always accept an\nentire write BIO without needing to split it.\n\nThis change does not have any effect on the read path of dm-crypt. Read\noperations can still be split and the BIO fragments processed in\nparallel. There is also no impact on the performance of the write path\ngiven that all zone write BIOs were already processed inline instead of\nin parallel.\n\nThis change also does not affect in any way regular dm-crypt block\ndevices."

Existing\nmitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspace\ncan additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after a\nVMexit.\n\nSince it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,\nconditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning to\nuserspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor and\nuserspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.\n\nThis new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. For\ninstance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() to\nget an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, the\nIBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before running\nuserspace.\n\nThe intent is to integrate and optimize these cases post-embargo.\n\n[ dhansen: elaborate on suboptimal IBPB solution ]"

Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027\n\nsystemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the\nmaximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory\ncontrol groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits\nsince memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked\nthat:\n\n1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum\n   size regardless of memcg accounting\n2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can\n   inadvertently trigger massive allocations\n3. The resulting allocations (>8GB) are impractical and will always fail\n\nsystemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value\nuntil the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open\nbeing set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file\ndescriptors.\n\nWhile processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal\noperation, certain selftests (like\ntools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file\ndescriptor limits can trigger this issue.\n\nFix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested\nallocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to\nfail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the\nimpractical >8GB memory allocation request."

That explains why there is no backref item for that\nbytenr and why btrfs check is not reporting anything wrong.\n\nBut this also shows another problem, as btrfs will do all the orphan\nsubvolume cleanup at a read-write mount.\n\nSo half-dropped subvolume should not exist after an RW mount, and\nbalance itself is also exclusive to subvolume cleanup, meaning we\nshouldn't hit a subvolume half-dropped during relocation.\n\nThe root cause is, there is no orphan item for this subvolume.\nIn fact there are 5 subvolumes from around 2021 that have the same\nproblem.\n\nIt looks like the original report has some older kernels running, and\ncaused those zombie subvolumes.\n\nThankfully upstream commit 8d488a8c7ba2 (\"btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshot\ndeletion not triggered on mount\") has long fixed the bug.\n\n[ENHANCEMENT]\nFor repairing such old fs, btrfs-progs will be enhanced.\n\nConsidering how delayed the problem will show up (at run delayed ref\ntime) and at that time we have to abort transaction already, it is too\nlate.\n\nInstead here we reject any half-dropped subvolume for reloc tree at the\nearliest time, preventing confusion and extra time wasted on debugging\nsimilar bugs."

Although UUIDv4 conversation IDs are generated server-side and are difficult to brute force, they can be obtained from less-protected sources such as server-side access logs, browser history, or screenshots. The vulnerability permits a logged-in user to gain read-only access to another user's conversations by exploiting the `/api/share/conversationID` endpoint, which lacks authorization checks. This issue is resolved in version v0.7.9-rc1."

         "summary" : "Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages. Angular uses a DI container (the \"platform injector\") to hold request-specific state during server-side rendering. For historical reasons, the container was stored as a JavaScript module-scoped global variable. When multiple requests are processed concurrently, they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state. In practical terms, this can lead to one request responding with data meant for a completely different request, leaking data or tokens included on the rendered page or in response headers. As long as an attacker had network access to send any traffic that received a rendered response, they may have been able to send a large number of requests and then inspect the responses for information leaks. The APIs `bootstrapApplication`, `getPlatform`, and `destroyPlatform` were vulnerable and required SSR-only breaking changes.\nThe issue has been patched in all active release lines as well as in the v21 prerelease. Patched packages include `@angular/platform-server` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.15, and 18.2.14 and `@angular/ssr` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.16, and 18.2.21. Several workarounds are available. Disable SSR via Server Routes or builder options, remove any asynchronous behavior from custom `bootstrap` functions, remove uses of `getPlatform()` in application code, and/or ensure that the server build defines `ngJitMode` as false."

In versions 1.11.3 and prior, the middleware functionality in Hoverfly is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability at `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware` endpoint due to insufficient validation and sanitization in user input. The vulnerability exists in the middleware management API endpoint `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware`. This issue is born due to combination of three code level flaws: Insufficient Input Validation in middleware.go line 94-96; Unsafe Command Execution in local_middleware.go line 14-19; and Immediate Execution During Testing in hoverfly_service.go line 173. This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) on any system running the vulnerable Hoverfly service. Since the input is directly passed to system commands without proper checks, an attacker can upload a malicious payload or directly execute arbitrary commands (including reverse shells) on the host server with the privileges of the Hoverfly process. Commit 17e60a9bc78826deb4b782dca1c1abd3dbe60d40 in version 1.12.0 disables the set middleware API by default, and subsequent changes to documentation make users aware of the security changes of exposing the set middleware API."

         "summary" : "Stalwart is a mail and collaboration server. Starting in version 0.12.0 and prior to version 0.13.3, a memory exhaustion vulnerability exists in Stalwart's CalDAV implementation that allows authenticated attackers to cause denial-of-service by triggering unbounded memory consumption through recurring event expansion. An authenticated attacker can crash the Stalwart server by creating recurring events with large payloads and triggering their expansion through CalDAV REPORT requests. A single malicious request expanding 300 events with 1000-character descriptions can consume up to 2 GB of memory. The vulnerability exists in the `ArchivedCalendarEventData.expand` function, which processes CalDAV `REPORT` requests with event expansion. When a client requests recurring events in their expanded form using the `<C:expand>` element, the server stores all expanded event instances in memory without enforcing size limits. Users should upgrade to Stalwart version 0.13.3 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrading is not possible, implement memory limits at the container/system level; monitor server memory usage for unusual spikes; consider rate limiting CalDAV REPORT requests; and restrict CalDAV access to trusted users only."

         "summary" : "PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. Due to a special entry being appended to `sys.path` during the bootstrap process of a PyInstaller-frozen application, and due to the bootstrap script attempting to load an optional module for bytecode decryption while this entry is still present in `sys.path`, an application built with PyInstaller < 6.0.0 may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into executing arbitrary python code when **all** of the following conditions are met. First, the application is built with PyInstaller < 6.0.0; both onedir and onefile mode are affected. Second, the optional bytecode encryption code feature was not enabled during the application build. Third, the attacker can create files/directories in the same directory where the executable is located. Fourth, the filesystem supports creation of files/directories that contain `?` in their name (i.e., non-Windows systems). Fifth, the attacker is able to determine the offset at which the PYZ archive is embedded in the executable. The attacker can create a directory (or a zip archive) next to the executable, with the name that matches the format used by PyInstaller's bootloader to transmit information about the location of PYZ archive to the bootstrap script. If this directory (or zip archive) contains a python module whose name matches the name used by the optional bytecode encryption feature, this module will be loaded and executed by the bootstrap script (in the absence of the real, built-in module that is available when the bytecode-encryption feature is enabled). This results in arbitrary code execution that requires no modification of the executable itself. If the executable is running with elevated privileges (for example, due to having the `setuid` bit set), the code in the injected module is also executed with the said elevated privileges, resulting in a local privilege escalation. PyInstaller 6.0.0 (f5adf291c8b832d5aff7632844f7e3ddf7ad4923) removed support for bytecode encryption; this effectively removes the described attack vector, due to the bootstrap script not attempting to load the optional module for bytecode-decryption anymore. PyInstaller 6.10.0 (cfd60b510f95f92cb81fc42735c399bb781a4739) reworked the bootstrap process to avoid (ab)using `sys.path` for transmitting location of the PYZ archive, which further eliminates the possibility of described injection procedure. If upgrading PyInstaller is not feasible, this issue can be worked around by ensuring proper permissions on directories containing security-sensitive executables (i.e., executables with `setuid` bit set) should mitigate the issue."

Himmelblau 0.9.x derives numeric GIDs for Entra ID groups from the group display name when himmelblau.conf `id_attr_map = name` (the default configuration). Because Microsoft Entra ID allows multiple groups with the same `displayName` (including end-user–created personal/O365 groups, depending on tenant policy), distinct directory groups can collapse to the same numeric GID on Linux. This issue only applies to Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.22. Any resource or service on a Himmelblau-joined host that enforces authorization by numeric GID (files/dirs, etc.) can be unintentionally accessible to a user who creates or joins a different Entra/O365 group that happens to share the same `displayName` as a privileged security group. Users should upgrade to 0.9.23, or 1.0.0 or later, to receive a patch. Group to GID mapping now uses Entra ID object IDs (GUIDs) and does not collide on same-name groups. As a workaround, use tenant policy hardening to restrict arbitrary group creation until all hosts are patched."

A command injection vulnerability in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior allows attackers with administrative privileges to obtain remote code execution on the application server. This vulnerability requires the application to have been cloned from GitHub and installed manually. When Tautulli is cloned directly from GitHub and installed manually, the application manages updates and versioning through calls to the `git` command. In the code, this is performed through the `runGit` function in `versioncheck.py`. Since `shell=True` is passed to `subproces.Popen`, this call is vulnerable to subject to command injection, as shell characters within arguments will be passed to the underlying shell. A concrete location where this can be triggered is in the `checkout_git_branch` endpoint. This endpoint stores a user-supplied remote and branch name into the `GIT_REMOTE` and `GIT_BRANCH` configuration keys without sanitization. Downstream, these keys are then fetched and passed directly into `runGit` using a format string. Hence, code execution can be obtained by using `$()` interpolation in a command. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue."

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 404 error handling logic of wabac.js v2.23.10 and below. The parameter `requestURL` (derived from the original request target) is directly embedded into an inline `<script>` block without sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser. The scope may be limited by CORS policies, depending on the situation in which wabac.js is used. The vulnerability is fixed in wabac.js v2.23.11."

Prior to version 0.3.5, in the Mermaid chart rendering component, there is a risky operation of directly using `innerHTML` to set user content. Therefore, any malicious content rendered via Mermaid will directly trigger the exploit chain, leading to command execution. This vulnerability is primarily caused by a failure to fully address the existing XSS issue in the project, leading to another exploit chain. The exploit chain is consistent with the report GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j, executing arbitrary JavaScript code via XSS and arbitrary commands via exposed IPC. Version 0.3.5 contains an updated fix."

In Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier, an attacker with administrative access can use the `pms_image_proxy` endpoint to write arbitrary python scripts into the application filesystem. This leads to remote code execution when combined with the `Script` notification agent. If an attacker with administrative access changes the URL of the PMS to a server they control, they can then abuse the `pms_image_proxy` to obtain a file write into the application filesystem. This can be done by making a `pms_image_proxy` request with a URL in the `img` parameter and the desired file name in the `img_format` parameter. Tautulli then uses a hash of the desired metadata together with the `img_format` in order to construct a file path. Since the attacker controls `img_format` which occupies the end of the file path, and `img_format` is not sanitised, the attacker can then use path traversal characters to specify filename of their choosing. If the specified file does not exist, Tautaulli will then attempt to fetch the image from the configured PMS. Since the attacker controls the PMS, they can return arbitrary content in response to this request, which will then be written into the specified file. An attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. The attacker can then make use of the built-in `Script` notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server.

In versions up to and including 1.1.0, every http request in addition to the session cookie `session` there included `nonce`. The value is not checked and validated by the backend, removing `nonce` allows the requests to be processed correctly.

Cross-site request forgery and cross-site scripting chained together can result in improper admin account creation. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available."

But obtaining the link would allow that user to perform any actions as the original user and access their data.

This allows attackers to inject malicious URLs using dangerous protocols (javascript:, data:, file:) or redirect users to external malicious sites. While native HTML anchor elements present similar risks, UI component libraries bear additional responsibility for implementing security safeguards and providing clear risk documentation.

This could allow attackers to conduct credential testing attacks, such as credential stuffing or password spraying, which poses a risk to accounts with weak or previously compromised passwords. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. For organizations with commercial Fides Enterprise licenses, configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) through an OIDC provider (like Azure, Google, or Okta) is an effective workaround.

The system incorrectly applies rate limits based on directly connected infrastructure IPs rather than client IPs, and stores counters in-memory rather than in a shared store. This allows attackers to bypass intended rate limits and potentially cause denial of service. This vulnerability only affects deployments relying on Fides's built-in rate limiting for protection. Deployments using external rate limiting solutions (WAFs, API gateways, etc.) are not affected. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. There are no application-level workarounds.

The file.download() method does not properly sanitize user-supplied filenames or validate the final download path. A maliciously crafted filename could contain path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../../../windows/system32/file.txt) or illegal characters that, when processed, would cause the file to be written outside of the intended target directory. An attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files or application configuration files, leading to a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution, depending on the context in which the library is used.  The vulnerability is particularly critical for users on Windows systems, but all operating systems are affected. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.1."

In versions 2.22.0 through 2.24.3, 2.25.0  and 2.25.1, Coder can be compromised through insecure session handling in prebuilt workspaces. Coder automatically generates a session token for a user when a workspace is started. It is automatically exposed via coder_workspace_owner.session_token. Prebuilt workspaces are initially owned by a built-in prebuilds system user. When a prebuilt workspace is claimed, a new session token is generated for the user that claimed the workspace, but the previous session token for the prebuilds user was not expired. Any Coder workspace templates that persist this automatically generated session token are potentially impacted. This is fixed in versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.2."

Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not\nhonor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that.\n\nThis problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states\nthat for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state\n(with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence\nconnections handled by the respective function break, and for future\nconnection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a\ndysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as\nwell.\n\nA kernel message like\n[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a\nis a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state\nwith PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like\n[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery\nis a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered\nbecause the ISM driver currently lacks support for it.\n\nOn a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to\nthe FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU\ntrying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that\nthis can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to\nPEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the\nfailure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command\nand executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs\nas if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not\nthe other one is also possible.  Frankly, I don't feel confident about\nproviding an exhaustive list of possible consequences."

This occurs when a power management (PM)\ninterrupt triggers just before the device-specific driver (e.g.,\nqat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains\nloaded.\n\nSince the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all\ndevices and owned by intel_qat.ko, a deferred routine from the\ndevice-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. If this\nroutine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed\nmemory, resulting in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:\n\n    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffa000002e50a01c\n    #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n    RIP: 0010:pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n    Call Trace:\n      pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n      process_one_work+0x171/0x340\n      worker_thread+0x277/0x3a0\n      kthread+0xf0/0x120\n      ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n\nTo prevent this, flush the misc workqueue during device shutdown to\nensure that all pending work items are completed before the driver is\nunloaded.\n\nNote: This approach may slightly increase shutdown latency if the\nworkqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness\nand stability."

This\ncreates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as\nrain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work\nhandler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.\n\nMultiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len\nbefore it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both\ninterrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len\nbeyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.\n\nFix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full\ncheck. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification\nare performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An corresponding\nspin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the\nlock.\n\nThis possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool\ndeveloped by our team."

A kernel\nbuffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples (each of which is an\n`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are\ncopied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.

For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if\n`insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn->n - 1` samples copied\nto userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.\n\nAnother culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the \"vm80xx\" driver.

         "summary" : "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal\n\nThis issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and\nfq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new\nlimit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs."

It is discouraged to\nunregister the netdev in this path, so the device may still be visible\nto userspace and kernel helpers.\n\nIn gve, shutdown() tears down most internal data structures. If an\nethtool operation is dispatched after shutdown(), it will dereference\nfreed or NULL pointers, leading to a kernel panic. While graceful\nshutdown normally quiesces userspace before invoking the reboot\nsyscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP VMs) can still trigger\nthis path.\n\nFix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown().\nThis marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handler\nwill skip dispatching operations to the driver."
